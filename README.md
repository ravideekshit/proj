In this project, an attempt would be made to deep-dive into the ‘Vinho Verde’ wine dataset, better understand it using exploratory data analysis and classify and predict the quality of the ‘Vinho Verde’ wine samples, for both the red and white wine types, using 4 different machine learning algorithms, namely: decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and support vector machine (SVM).  

The data we would be using for our analysis, would be the ‘Vinho Verde’ wine samples available on the UCI, Machine Learning Repository, 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality.
This wine quality dataset would contain physiochemical information related to both the red and white wine variants of the Portuguese ‘Vinho Verde’ wine, obtained from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. This dataset was donated by Paulo Cortez, Full Professor at the Department of Information Systems, School of Engineering, University of Minho, Portugal to the UCI Data Repository on October 07, 2009. 

The dataset would contain a total of twelve attributes. There would be a total of 4898 samples of the white wine variant and 1599 samples of the red wine variant. 
Both the red and white wine samples would be described by a set of eleven physicochemical features. These physicochemical attributes would be: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol content. All these eleven attributes would be continuously distributed and would be of the ‘float’ datatype. 

The twelfth attribute would be the quality attribute, which can be considered as a sensory information indicator, indicating a quality score between 0 and 10 and would be of the ‘integer’ datatype. This quality attribute would be our attribute of interest and would be the attribute, we would be attempting to classify and predict by applying the machine learning algorithms.
